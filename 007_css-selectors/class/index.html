<p class="emphasize">Ali G is a sarcastic take on rich suburban teenagers thinking they are tough. It includes the following communities:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="emphasize">Caucasians</li>
  <li>Asians</li>
  <li>Indians</li>
</ul>

<p>Ali G, the U.K.'s hottest comic sensation, makes his way to American audiences with "Ali G Indahouse." In his big-screen debut, the chilled-out, hip-hopping, white gangsta-rapper wannabe finds himself in the bizarre position of having to resolve one of Great Britain's biggest national and political scandals. Abetted by his loyal crew, the West Staines Massive and long-suffering girlfriend Me Julie, he emerges as the unlikeliest of heroes.</p>
